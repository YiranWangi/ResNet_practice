# Malaria Cell Classification with Residual Neural Network

## Abstract
Malaria is a transmittable disease caused by the parasites which belong to the Plasmodium family which is spread by the bite of the female mosquito. In the past, they were detected by trained microscopists who analyze microscopic blood smear images. However in recent years, a series of deep learning methods had been appeared. In this passage, we use ResNet with different parameters to classify Malaria cell images. We preprocess a dataset with more than 27,000 Malaria cell images from more than 350 patients. On this dataset, we train a convolutional neural network which outputs the classification accuracy and loss. By using transfer learning, we find the best network architecture in which we can classify the cells with the accuracy of 94.93%.
